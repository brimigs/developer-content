[Radar](https://github.com/Auditware/radar?tab=readme-ov-file) is static
analysis tool for anchor rust programs. It allows you to write, share, and
utilize templates to identify security issues in rust-based smart contracts
using a powerful python based rule engine that enables automating detection of
vulnerable code patterns through logical expressions.

[Xray](https://github.com/sec3-product/x-ray) is an open-source, cross-platform
command-line interface (CLI) tool designed for static analysis of Solana
programs and smart contracts written in Rust.
