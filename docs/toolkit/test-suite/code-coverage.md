```shell
mucho coverage
```

This command will run a code coverage test on all of your Rust tests and then
generate report in an HTML page with in depth metrics on where additional code
may be needed to improve your current code coverage.

Note: So far, this tool only works on tests written in Rust and is not
compatible with a JavaScript test suite.
