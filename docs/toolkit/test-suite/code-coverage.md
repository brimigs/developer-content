```shell
npx mucho coverage
```

## Overview

This command will run a code coverage test on all of your Rust tests and then
generates a report as an HTML page providing metrics on where additional tests
may be needed to improve your current code coverage.

> Currently, this tool only works on tests written in Rust and is not compatible
> with a JavaScript test suite.
