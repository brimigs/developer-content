```shell
npx mucho coverage
```

## Overview

This command will run a code coverage test on all of your Rust tests and then
generate a report in an HTML page providing metrics on where additional code may
be needed to improve your current code coverage.

> Currently, this tool only works on tests written in Rust and is not compatible
> with a JavaScript test suite.
