```shell
yarn create expo-app --template @solana-mobile/solana-mobile-expo-template
```

This is initializing a new project using the Expo framework that is specifically
designed for creating mobile applications that interact with the Solana
blockchain.

Follow their
[Running the app](https://docs.solanamobile.com/react-native/expo#running-the-app)
guide to launch the template as a custom development build and get it running on
your Android emulator. Once you have built the program and are running a dev
client with Expo, the emulator will automatically update every time you save
your code.

To use this template, you will also need to set up the following:

- [Android Studio and Emulator](https://docs.solanamobile.com/getting-started/development-setup)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?platform=android)
- [EAS CLI and Account](https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/)
